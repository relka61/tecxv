            <p>The city feels the same as always. A little colder than yesterday, maybe, but nothing worth remembering. <br>
                Stopped by the cafe for a while, ordered the usual, didn't finish it. The people next to me were talking about some film I haven't seen, "Lost Signal", something about the ending not making sense. <br>
                And late trains yet again. I stood there watching the board flick through times, delays piling up. <br>
                Gotta love the big companies.</p>
